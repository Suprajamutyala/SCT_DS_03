Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

# Dataset 

Source: Titanic Dataset from Kaggle

Description: Contains details about Titanic passengers including class, gender, age, ticket fare, cabin, embarkation port, and survival status

# Process Followed 

# Data Cleaning

- Treated missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns

- Removed duplicates and irrelevant fields

- Converted categorical data into appropriate formats

# Exploratory Data Analysis

- Studied the distribution of numerical and categorical variables

- Analyzed survival patterns based on passenger class, gender, and age

- Visualized correlations between important features

- Identified significant factors that influenced survival

# Key Insights 

- Female passengers had higher survival rates than males

- First-class passengers had better chances of survival than those in second and third class

- Younger passengers, especially children, had higher survival rates compared to older passengers

- The port of embarkation showed variation in survival rates

# Tools and Libraries 

- Python

- Pandas

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

- Seaborn

# Conclusion 

- The analysis highlights how exploratory data analysis can uncover important trends and relationships in data.
- In the Titanic dataset, gender, class, and age were the most significant factors that influenced survival chances.
